Fun...I've never had so much fun in my life...

ID=303003
I knew I wasn't bluffing....

ID=303004
If only my arms could move more, I would still be able to fight...

ID=303005
...That's amazing.

Everyone should feel fear before death, but \nI didn't think you could be so unconcerned.

ID=303007
I don't want to be disfigured as a loser forever.

ID=303008
Now, please hurry up and take this senseless life...!

ID=305001
Why...why...?

ID=305002
Where have you been, playing along with the kids?

ID=305003
Please behave yourself a little better.

ID=305004
Why are you doing this...? \nI...did I do something wrong ......?

ID=305005
I want to have friends too...but I want to go to the zoo too...

ID=305006
Why are you telling me not to do anything?

ID=305007
You're not human, of course you're not.

ID=305008
I'm not human, am I?

ID=305009
Can't I be happy because I'm not human?

ID=305010
Yes! That's right!

ID=305011
Then I'll just... destroy everything...

ID=305012
If you take it all, I'll destroy it all too.

ID=305013
Hahahaha!

ID=305014
If you can do it, you can do it, monster!

People tend to rely on half knowledge when they're in a hurry.

ID=302002
If you show them the part where the alter's arm comes off a few times, they'll learn.

ID=302003
When they see an arm come off of a person who looks like them, they'll assume it's their alter ego without question.

ID=302004
So you made me cut off my arm to trick those people?

ID=302005
This is insane.

ID=302006
Haha, there's nothing more boring than being insane!

ID=302007
How about you? Now that you're out of there, why don't you try living a more enjoyable life?

ID=302008
No, I'm fine with boring days.

ID=302009
Darn...I'm boring.

ID=301001
Mr. Irwin...Mr. Irwin?

ID=301002
I, I finally understand. \nI understand now why I was feeling bad, what I was misunderstanding... everything!

ID=301003
These people...these people in the void...they're all the same as the void... \nI'm not a human, I'm part of the void!

ID=301004
I should've killed them all! All of them!

ID=301005
Haha... hahaha...

ID=301006
I knew I wasn't wrong.

ID=301007
I told you. I told you that your face looks good when you smile like that...
