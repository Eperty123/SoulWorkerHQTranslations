Ralph saw Brock and Henry arguing and seemed to sense that something had happened. \frx346\fnDroid Sans Fallback}Some time ago, a Ned Company transport plane crashed into a compound near Candace City... \The Ned Company's manipulation of information was something that even Ralph felt was suspicious. \Although he was not sure, he ordered an investigation of the mansion. \After the investigation began, they found the wreckage of the Ned Company's transport plane, a huge capsule that looked like something had slipped out of it, and a familiar ribbon. \It was Katherine's.

Aaron decided that if it was a unique soul junk, then the Ned Company would have the information and ordered them to get it out of Henry. \Block struck Henry, who continued to sober up, and made him spit out information about the Queen Spider. \It was code-named Arachnis. \They used Henry's information to find Arachnis's lair and managed to rescue Catherine. \However, Catherine had already been captured by the vacuum vane.

Brock was able to get the information on the antidote from Henry in exchange for the destruction of the files on Ned Company's many misdeeds. \He claimed that the antidote was in N-102. \But the lab was already a den of soul junk... \They risked a search of N-102, but were unable to find the antidote. \When Brock returned from N-102, he was frustrated and asked for Victor's whereabouts. \But... there was no sign of Victor.

Unfinished Product
Henry confirmed that the antidote was real. \However, in order to use it, he would need the mucus of Beholder, the one who had turned the lab into a den of soul junk. \The Ned Company wanted to control Beholder and monopolize the production of the antidote to soul junking, but that didn't matter now. \In addition to obtaining the beholder's mucus, Henry had also ordered the self-destruct mechanism to be activated in the lab.

He then headed to the shelter with Aaron. Catherine's condition was getting worse by the day.

Grace City
We arrived in Grace City, known as the City of Grace, in search of Henry. It was a peaceful city, quite different from the ones we had seen before. Thor, the temporary commander of Grace City, told us that since the Staley Forest Coalition and the Ned Company were cooperating with each other externally, they couldn't officially help us track down Henry. However, they could help us informally, and they wanted us to find evidence of his misdeeds at all costs. We exchanged brief greetings with the members stationed in Grace City, but there was a strange man among them.

Cold Air
We arrived at the Ruin Fortress, a former military fortress of the Ned Company, following the reactions of the near-soul workers with Kane Barrel. The fortress was made of steel, and combined with the cold air around it, it seemed even more silent. The fact that there was no one there now, and that it had ceased to function, strengthened that impression. \nThe members of the Staley Forest Coalition had already arrived. I exchanged a brief greeting with Martin, who was in charge of operations, Amanda, who was in charge of communications, and Sarah, who was in charge of energy, and received an explanation of the current situation. Since they were a hastily formed team, they didn't have a good grasp of the facility, and since they hadn't met each other before, teamwork was unlikely. \Kane Barrel, who had heard the story, sighed as if he was disappointed.

Girl's World
Despite being a hastily assembled team, each individual was highly capable, and they quickly set about assessing the current situation and facilities. The biggest problem was control of the power. The power of the Ruin Fortress was still alive, but the control rights were locked. \Amanda guessed that there had to be an AI that could take control of it. Amanda guessed that there had to be an AI that could take control of the facility. The decision was that an AI-grade control system would inevitably be needed to control such a large facility. \If we can't secure control of the facility, there's nothing we can do, let alone search for the near-soul workers. Therefore, the first step was to enter the facility to confirm the existence of the AI that would be holding the control of the facility. \As a result of the internal investigation, it was confirmed that the AI was present and that the interior of the shuttle where the near-soul worker had been riding was already a shell of its former self. The next step, then, was to secure the AI... "Lucy". With the fear that Lucy might recognize us as the enemy in our hearts, we proceeded forward.

Created Hostility
Sarah says that it is hard to believe that an AI so seemingly self-aware could be operated by a single piece of headwear. There must be many sub-AI cores supporting the main AI core, she said. \Since we don't have the technology to hack Lucy, and since Lucy is hostile to us, our plan is to physically destroy the sub-AI cores to reduce their computing power, and then secure Lucy through hacking. \It was a risky plan, as if we were going to be killed by the enemy, but Kane Barrel returned to Grace City after receiving an emergency call. \nThe situation was not good, but they managed to get inside, destroy the sub-AI core, and wait for the hack to be executed from the garrison. However, it turned out that no one at the garrison had any hacking skills, and just as I was about to return with a feeling of emptiness in my heart, a young boy appeared in front of me.

The Remaining Child
The boy was a refugee left behind by an incident in Ruinfortress. His name is "Abel". The boy's anxious and frightened appearance was so painful that I hurried to take him back to the garrison. \At the garrison, Martin, who suspected Abel, and Amanda, who criticized him, argued, but Amanda ended up asking Abel what happened to him.

Give Lucy a good spanking!
Abel is the son of a researcher who was involved in the development of the Ruin Fortress, and his entire family had been living in the Ruin Fortress, but he seemed to have suffered a sudden accident. It must have something to do with the fact that he hadn't seen anyone here at all. Abel was surviving on emergency rations in a secret room, and when he felt the presence of people, he called for help. Abel, who said he was the son of a \n researcher, told us how to secure power for the Ruin Fortress. Lucy is just an AI that works in place of a person. As long as we delete her, he said, the control of the facility will naturally be in our hands. \I hurriedly formatted Lucy and took control of the facility, but another problem arose.

Three for one.
We had gained control of the facility, but we lacked the power to run it. At present, they could only open and close the doors. \Sarah argued that since it existed as a fortress in the first place, it should not be dependent on external power. Abel agreed with Sara's words. \The Ruin Fortress is operated by an autonomous power source called the Buster Core. The Buster Core is responsible for obtaining power from the three Slave Cores and converting it into electricity, and once all the Slave Cores are operational, the Ruin Fortress will be able to freely use the power. As \n Abel had said, the Slave Cores were successfully activated, and power was successfully supplied to the Ruinfortress.

But then another problem arose. The Slavecore was recognized as having been activated by a "non-recognizer", and the remaining two Slavecores recognized the activated Slavecore as an "enemy", blocking the power generated from it. \Sara eventually decides to physically destroy the two Slave Cores, just as she did with Lucy. If the two power sources are destroyed, the power will be reduced by more than half, but in the current situation, there is no way to make the "allies" recognize that the slave cores have been activated. As long as we don't know what the near-soulworkers are trying to do here, we have to start searching for them as soon as possible. On my way back after destroying the \n Slavecore, I felt a strange buzzing coming from the garrison. It was said that Abel had suddenly disappeared.

The boy's true intentions
Abel's reaction was confirmed in the depths of the Buster Core. There are many mysteries as to how he got there and when he disappeared, but for now, our priority is to get Abel in custody. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}While the search was underway, I felt something strange about Chloe's demeanor. It seemed as if she was a different person, so I pursued her, and suddenly Abel's image appeared on the operator display. As he was completely unable to grasp the situation, Abel suddenly emerged from the Buster Core. \He then announced that he was a Near Soul Worker.

Abel uttered a thank-you that could hardly be described as gratitude for the work we had done, and then disappeared. When we tracked Abel to the deepest level of the Buster Core, he began to absorb the energy of the Buster Core. When he tried to stop Abel, another Near Soul Worker, Noah, stood in front of him. \nThe battle dragged on, and Abel absorbed all of the Buster Core's Energy and fled with Noah. When he returned to the \n garrison, he found everyone in a state of stupor.

Chasing the Light
Abel had absorbed most of the Buster Core's energy, which threw a wrench in the facility's control plan. Since we had no choice, we decided to start a full-scale operation to search for the near-soul worker with minimal facility control. It was decided to proceed with the pursuit of Abel, which we could do at present. Abel had absorbed the energy of the Buster Core, which had waves specific to \n, and as a result of tracking those waves, we confirmed a reaction underground. The reaction was as if it was guiding us. \When we went down to the basement, we found a shuttle transfer path. The area didn't look large enough to be traversed by shuttle... We proceeded to search, but at the end of the shuttle route, we found a huge door blocking the way. With heavy footsteps, I returned to the garrison.

A Sudden Encounter
There was currently no way to open the gate that was blocking the way, so I entered the shuttle transfer path by another route. The boring search mission continued, but suddenly, we encountered Ned Company's troops in the shuttle travel route. \A small battle broke out, and the man who seemed to be their leader fled, but one old man, who looked frail, stood silently in his place. He didn't seem to be flinching or in a hurry. He looked so calm, as if he had been waiting for a situation like this.

The old man who came back to the garrison with me is named "Hicks". He's a doctor belonging to Ned Company, and is said to be Cloudream's foremost authority on bioengineering. \It was clear that he had approached the Staley Forest Coalition with a purpose, but he never said what that purpose was. In the end, they gave up trying to get information from Hicks and entered the shuttle travel path again. \nThen, at the end of the shuttle travel path... where there was a huge iron door, they encountered another near-soul worker named Enoch. \Like Noah, Enoch didn't seem to be giving it his all. Enoch retreated, leaving behind some strange words as if he had some kind of inner workings. \After finishing the battle, he surveyed the energy reaction on the other side of the door and confirmed that it was the energy from the Buster Core that Abel had absorbed.

Behind a huge iron door was an armory. In addition, there were anti-personnel weapons that had been banned by treaty. It was proof that the Ned Company had been preparing for war with the Stary Forest Coalition from the very beginning. \frx346\fnDroid Sans Fallback}And now we have new information from Amanda. She said that the movement of the energetic reaction was decreasing. \In other words, it was clear that Abel was doing something in a specific location with the energy from the Buster Core.

It was obvious that Hicks knew what Abel was up to, but when he pursued him, he simply fell silent. Martin gave up trying to get information out of Hicks and changed his mission from searching for the Near Soul Worker to defeating the Near Soul Worker. Hicks was surprised by his words and asked him to wait a bit. \Hicks said that he was sure that the place Abel was heading to was the Deep Core, where the true power source of the Ruin Fortress was located, and he led everyone there. \The Deep Core, which they arrived at with the help of Hicks, was located underneath the Ruin Fortress and looked like a bottomless ant hell.

Down, deeper.
Hicks explained that Abel had absorbed the power of the Buster Core in order to activate the deus ex machina, and that he had challenged him to battle with the deus ex machina because he needed the soul energy that only soulworkers possess. \The deus ex machina, which was created as a weapon for soul workers, had the ability to absorb the unique energy of soul workers into its core, and through the battle, the core gathered the unique energy of soul workers. \Abel's goal was to use that energy to activate the Deep Core. Only Soul Workers can activate the Deep Core, which is why the high-ranking executives of Ned Company are all made up of Soul Workers. \nAbel was a soul worker who was created. He was able to mimic the size of his power, but the inherent energy itself was different in nature, so he needed the power of a real soul worker. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}The true purpose of this is still unknown, but it seems that Abel must be stopped.

Hicks says that the vibrations are caused by the activation of the Dig Monster, a super-sized drilling machine. As its name implies, it is a "monster that digs up the earth", having constructed the terrain of Ruin Fortress in a month with only seven Digmonsters. Abel was going to use this to revive the prototype near-soul worker "Zion" that lies deep underground. \nSion is the strongest and worst near-soul worker that slaughtered everyone in Ruinfortress and was sealed in the basement of Ruinfortress, and Hicks spills that if he is resurrected, it will be the end of Ned Company or the Staley Forest Coalition. \fnDroid Sans Fallback \fnDroid Sans Fallback \fnDroid Sans Fallback \nIn order to stop Zion's resurrection, we have to stop the Dig Monster. \Even if it makes Abel sad...

The place where Abel and Zion's reactions were confirmed was a huge construction facility. With the only thing left to do was to stop \n Abel and prevent Zion's resurrection, Hicks opened his mouth. Project Ark was a top-secret project of the Ned Company with the goal of creating soul workers by human hands. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}The prototypical near-soul worker, Xion, was the product of this project. Her spirit was destroyed by an inhumane experiment and went out of control, slaughtering everyone in Ruin Fortress and sealing her deep underground. \nHicks revealed that he was in charge of the project, and as he watched the sequence of events, he realized the fact that they were just ordinary children. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}And Hicks spoke of his wish that the children who had been victimized by the mistakes of adults would now be able to live an ordinary life. \nIn order to let them live an ordinary life, the building facility they entered to prevent the Slaughter Witch from waking up again was a place where they were building spaceships.

When I return to the garrison, I am informed that Hicks has disappeared. According to Amanda, Hicks had gone to the Arkship construction site. \Disillusioned with the fact that he had only watched from the sidelines with his arms bound while claiming to be atoning for the children, Hicks decided to make his own move. Amanda lends him a hand. She knew that Hicks was going to die. \Amanda wanted Hicks to be punished for his biological experiments, and Martin reprimanded Amanda for her actions. She said that a man like Hicks should not atone for his sins by dying, but by living in pain. \On the way to the Arkship after Hicks, he found Hicks with Jake of Ned Company. Hicks was deeply wounded by Jake's bullet. I hurriedly took control of Ned Company and checked on Hicks' condition... \fnDroid Sans Fallback}Hicks' condition was already too late. He closed his eyes quietly, ridiculing himself for only being able to stay on the sidelines until the end.

I headed back to the Arkship to prepare for the final battle. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}Just as I was about to defeat Abel, who was standing right in front of me, and secure Sion, Sion woke up to Abel's near scream. An overwhelming force. A space that doesn't even allow you to get close. There was nothing I could do but just get hit. As Sion was hit and his consciousness began to wander, a golden light enveloped his surroundings. I'm not sure what I remember after that. \I don't remember anything except that I heard a voice that I had heard somewhere before. When I returned to the garrison, Martin asked me what had happened, but I didn't know anything either.

And to the truth
After overcoming the temptation of the shadows, it was Roy who appeared in front of the soul worker. \His face was different from usual as he laughed while saying things that didn't make sense to him. After returning to the Glass Cover Camp and calming down, the Soul Worker headed straight for Grace City and looked for Roy, but Roy and Neve had already disappeared from the park in Grace City. Thor had said he was taking a "vacation"... but was it really true?

Anomalies
After the fierce battle, all that remained was emptiness with nowhere to go. The near-soulworkers, including Sion, suddenly disappeared, leaving nothing behind. \The powerful energy generated by the battle between Sion and the golden armor-clad woman, Roskar, increased the activity of the Abnormal Void, and the world began to be enveloped in chaos. After failing to secure the Near Soul Worker, the Soul Worker lost its purpose, and the investigation team of Ruin Fortress was sent to investigate the huge anomalous void with the peculiarity of being able to come and go freely.

Eerie Void
What the soul worker saw in the huge anomalous void was rainwater pouring into the crumbling buildings and gaps in the earth, and an eerie purple sky. Nothing was left of the city, which seemed to have been swallowed up by the blankness of the ground, making it worthy of being called the land of the dead. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}The garrison of the Staley Forest Coalition who had been stationed there earlier introduced me to a man who claimed to be Tenebris ......, a legendary soul worker who was said to have died five years ago.

Auditory hallucinations
The "Spirit Pathfinder" we set up to confirm the presence of survivors is useless because it can't detect soul energy. Amanda, who is in charge of communications, says she heard a strange voice during the communication. It seems that the investigation inside the void is not going smoothly after all. \The soulworkers were confronted by the remnants of Rapid Flame, who had killed many people in the past, codenamed Tempest. It seems that they were planning to use the machine, which can suck energy from the atmosphere, to do something, but their plan was crushed by the Soul Worker.

I told Tenebris about what I saw in the anomalous void, and he assured me that all of this was not surprising inside the void. Apparently, this is "Desire Energy's territory". The overwhelming Desire Energy that fills this space causes phenomena that are beyond the comprehension of common sense with the power of its desire. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}Martin seemed to have doubts about the fact that he could still use Soul Energy, which was supposed to repel and neutralize the Desire Energy, but Tenebris interjected to dismiss his doubts. \fnDroid Sans Fallback}Miriam seemed to be paying close attention to Tenebris, but from the looks of it, it would take quite a while for her to talk to him.

Dieprus Port City
Aaron couldn't help but be intrigued by the name Henry that Benelis had mentioned. \nBenelis explained that Henry was in the port city of Dieps, where he was searching for the Souljunk Queen and planning to destroy the world. \I wanted him not to go there because it was too dangerous, but Aaron ignored his words and I went to Diprus half on my own volition to look for clues about Henry.

Operation Heavenly Dominion
We arrived at the port city of Dieprus, which had already been taken over by the Soul Junk and was in ruins. Having finally settled in a place across the sea from the \n sinkhole, we needed to build a garrison in a hurry. To do so, based on Brock's opinion, we needed to capture the highest point in the area, which was the roof of the building.

One who rages with madness
When we returned after our first defense line build, Aaron was angry with one of the soldiers. \nThe soldier wanted a safer mission for a little while longer, but as he began to accept each person's circumstances and needs, he said, "None of us would stay in a hellhole like this. \fnDroid Sans Fallback \fnDroid Sans Fallback \fnDroid Sans Fallback \fnDroid Sans Fallback

Aaron had a pendant with a picture of Katherine on it. I asked to see it, but the cold attitude that came back was enough to confirm that Aaron had changed. \But when he heard that Brock had let the soldier live, it gave him a renewed sense of purpose, of helping people.

Meaningless.
Our next mission was to get rid of the giant soul junk that was moving between the buildings. There was no danger of this place being compromised or attacked, but Aaron forced me into battle for the purpose of collecting combat data. \Again, I wondered if fighting for such a reason meant anything, but it seemed that I could no longer afford to worry about that.

Long time no spare
With the construction of the garrison completed, we needed to investigate down the sinkhole in earnest. However, it was impossible to jump down a place of unknown depth. In order to arrange for equipment capable of descending the sinkhole, we went to Thor in Ruinfortress.

When the soldiers were frustrated and tired from the unreasonable work of building the garrison and the continuous installation work without a break, they finally stole a ship and escaped. \Aaron and Benelis decided to ignore the descent machine installation work and keep quiet as there was no time to pursue the escaped soldiers, but the situation changed when Aaron's pendant disappeared.

Under the huge hole
The descent machine has been installed and the investigation of the sinkhole has begun. During the descent, they found a certain laboratory that Ned may have used in the past for his souljunk experiments. \blur1}Benelis was unhappy with the idea of investigating this lab first, and rebelled against it, but forced a detailed investigation into what Queen and Ned had done in the past.
